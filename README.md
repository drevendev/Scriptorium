# Scriptorium · Reader preview

**Understand the language of a text without uploading the manuscript.**
Scriptorium measures vocabulary, sentence length, dialogue and punctuation, then produces
readable offline reports and reproducible data. This **0.4.0a1 preview** adds private
comparison of two analyses to the canonical Reader and its real-work gallery.

## Try your own text

With Python 3.13 or later, from this checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install .
scriptorium analyze manuscript.txt --format html --output report.html
scriptorium analyze manuscript.txt --output analysis.json
scriptorium analyze manuscript.txt --format csv --output metrics.csv
```

Open `report.html` locally. All **29 metric rows** retain their units and algorithm
profiles; unavailable measurements stay unknown. The report has readable metric names,
a four-value overview, exact numeric values and keyboard-accessible tables. JSON and
CSV include source digests, not manuscript content. Choose a new output filename for
each run: existing files are never overwritten.

No runtime dependencies, account, server or telemetry are required. Installation may
fetch build tools; see [offline wheel installation](docs/READER_PREVIEW.md).
`python -m scriptorium` exposes the same commands from a checkout.

## Compare your own analyses

```bash
scriptorium analyze second-manuscript.txt --output second-analysis.json
scriptorium compare analysis.json second-analysis.json --output comparison.html
scriptorium compare analysis.json second-analysis.json --format json --output comparison.json
scriptorium compare analysis.json second-analysis.json --format csv --output comparison.csv
```

Open `comparison.html` for the same 29 measurements, explicit units, source identities
and **right minus left** differences. Percentage differences use percentage points.
Unknown measurements do not become zero; different methods or dictionaries are labelled
incomparable where applicable. JSON decimal observations and their differences retain
precision. Contradictory counts, means, punctuation rates and same-text results are rejected.
Imported JSON and hashes are declarations, not authenticated proof: rerun the analyzer
on the original bytes to verify them. [Comparison contract and examples](docs/PRIVATE_COMPARISON.md).

## Open a real literary result

The repository contains a source-free, historical full-work diagnostic for
**Anna Karenina**: **28 expected/actual/delta rows**, with 23 numeric results and five
unavailable values. No novel download is needed:

```bash
scriptorium diagnostic benchmarks/fantlab/work270306-wikisource-diagnostic.json \
  --title "Anna Karenina — full-work diagnostic" --output anna-report.html
scriptorium site --repo-root . --output build/site
```

Open `anna-report.html` or `build/site/index.html`. The canonical site retains the five
earlier evidence/report routes and the Reader 0.3 two-book comparison route.
**A successful local build is not a live GitHub Pages deployment.** The Pages activation
interlock is unchanged; this preview does not enable publishing by itself. Atomic site
replacement currently requires Linux `renameat2`; unsupported platforms fail without
deleting the previous build. Private text analysis and comparison are separate capabilities.

## Compare two already-analyzed books

No manuscript download or morphology setup is needed for the frozen **Running on Waves**
and **Children of Captain Grant — Beketova translation** comparison:

```bash
mkdir -p build
python -m scriptorium.full_work_gallery --repo-root . --format html > build/full-work-gallery.html
python -m scriptorium.full_work_gallery --repo-root . --format csv > build/full-work-evidence.csv
```

Open `build/full-work-gallery.html` for ten exact measurements and seven row-wise charts.
These are Scriptorium-side results, not FantLab parity or author-style scores. The pinned
canonical site route is `build/site/works/two-full-work-differences/index.html`, with
`measurements.json` and `measurements.csv` downloads. Navigation and export links have
44-pixel minimum touch targets; visible focus and reduced-motion styles are retained.
Newly approved replacement evidence must declare compatible source units before display;
legacy Grin diagnostics are not assigned invented source-unit fields.
Building this route does not prove GitHub Pages is deployed. Shell redirection replaces
its destination; use new filenames to keep older exports. [Method and limits](docs/FULL_WORK_GALLERY.md).

## What the results mean

FantLab-shaped metrics are **inferred compatibility candidates**, not demonstrated
parity. Scriptorium-only features are **extensions**. The historical Anna diagnostic
has no established identity match to FantLab's input text. **M2 remains 0/5**; none of
M1–M5 is declared complete by this preview. The AOT-lineage morphology target and
field-by-field parity criteria remain unchanged.

Texts shorter than 300,000 characters including spaces are valid inputs with explicit
representativeness limits. That length is a corpus-admission floor, not a guarantee of
quality; legal provenance and source identity require separate evidence. Source books,
private manuscripts and dictionary contents are not included in reports or uploaded.
Hashes can identify known works; share derived reports deliberately.

## Safety and reproducibility

The CLI bounds manuscripts to 32 MiB and dictionaries and comparison reports to 8 MiB
per file, rejects special files and symlinks, and uses a create-only atomic writer.
Operational errors do not echo private paths or source text. CSV neutralizes formula-like
**text** while preserving numeric cells; spreadsheet import/save behavior is not universally guaranteed.

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m pip wheel --no-deps . --wheel-dir dist
```

The Reader workflow runs the complete canonical suite, builds a full wheel and tests it
outside the checkout: actual manuscript analysis/comparison, HTML/JSON/CSV, historical
report, safe failures and deterministic source-free gallery/site. No analyzer stubs are
used in the private-comparison acceptance. Package, project and CLI versions must agree.
The full Python public API, morphology modules, benchmark data and corpus records remain
in place. No external package-registry release is performed by CI.

Site locks are persistent regular files whose kernel locks are released on process death.
Do not delete a lock file while a publisher could be using it. Legacy directory locks
from an interrupted older preview fail closed and are not automatically deleted.

The detailed [Research and evidence index](RESEARCH_INDEX.md) retains project history,
corpus investigations and original reference links. Unpublished EPUB/batch Workbench
and browser Comparison Desk prototypes are **not** advertised as released features;
they require focused adoption and real repository tests. Code/data licensing and Pages
activation retain their separately tracked gates (#284/#285).
